# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Email Preview Enhancement feature will improve the existing email preview section by showing actual HTML previews of how emails look on different platforms, rather than just text-based information. Additionally, it will add an info icon that, when clicked, displays detailed information about each platform's capabilities and limitations. This enhancement will provide users with a more visual and informative experience when previewing their email logos across different email clients.

## Requirements

### Requirement 3
