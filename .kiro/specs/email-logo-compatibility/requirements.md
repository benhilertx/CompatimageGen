# Requirements Document

## Introduction

CompatimageGen is a web-based productivity tool that generates universal email logo compatibility code blocks. The application accepts various logo formats (SVG, PNG/JPEG, CSS) and produces a single HTML code block with layered fallbacks (SVG, PNG, VML) that ensures consistent logo display across major email clients including Gmail, Outlook Desktop, Apple Mail, and others. The tool eliminates the need for external image hosting by embedding assets as inline base64 data URIs and provides downloadable fallback files in a ZIP package.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer or marketer, I want to upload a logo file in various formats, so that I can generate email-compatible HTML code without worrying about format compatibility.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the application THEN the system SHALL display a drag-and-drop upload interface
2. WHEN a user uploads a file THEN the system SHALL accept SVG, PNG, JPEG, and CSS files
3. WHEN a user uploads a file larger than 1MB THEN the system SHALL reject the file and display an error message
4. WHEN a user uploads an invalid file format THEN the system SHALL reject the file and display a format error message
5. WHEN a user uploads a valid file THEN the system SHALL validate the file structure and display a success confirmation

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to automatically optimize my logo files, so that the generated code performs well across email clients.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an SVG file is uploaded THEN the system SHALL minify the SVG using SVGO optimization
2. WHEN a PNG or JPEG file is uploaded THEN the system SHALL compress the image using Sharp library
3. WHEN any file is processed THEN the system SHALL convert it to base64 data URI format
4. WHEN an SVG contains complex elements THEN the system SHALL warn the user about potential VML compatibility issues
5. WHEN optimization is complete THEN the system SHALL display the optimized file size to the user

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to generate fallback formats automatically, so that my logo displays correctly in all major email clients.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an SVG is processed THEN the system SHALL generate a PNG fallback using Sharp rasterization
2. WHEN an SVG is processed THEN the system SHALL generate VML code for Outlook Desktop compatibility
3. WHEN a CSS logo is processed THEN the system SHALL convert it to inline styles or rasterize to PNG
4. WHEN VML conversion encounters complex SVG shapes THEN the system SHALL default to PNG fallback and warn the user
5. WHEN all fallbacks are generated THEN the system SHALL validate each format for email client compatibility

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to receive a complete HTML code block with all fallbacks, so that I can paste it directly into my email template.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing is complete THEN the system SHALL generate a single HTML code block with layered fallbacks
2. WHEN generating HTML THEN the system SHALL include VML code wrapped in Outlook conditional comments
3. WHEN generating HTML THEN the system SHALL include inline SVG for vector-supporting clients
4. WHEN generating HTML THEN the system SHALL include base64 PNG as universal fallback
5. WHEN generating HTML THEN the system SHALL ensure responsive design with max-width and height auto properties

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to download a ZIP package with all necessary files and instructions, so that I have everything needed for email integration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing is complete THEN the system SHALL generate a ZIP file containing all output files
2. WHEN creating the ZIP THEN the system SHALL include the HTML snippet file
3. WHEN creating the ZIP THEN the system SHALL include the fallback PNG file
4. WHEN creating the ZIP THEN the system SHALL include markdown instructions for email platform integration
5. WHEN creating the ZIP THEN the system SHALL include preview images showing expected rendering in major email clients

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see preview estimates of how my logo will appear in different email clients, so that I can verify the output before using it.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing is complete THEN the system SHALL display text-based previews for Apple Mail, Gmail, and Outlook Desktop
2. WHEN generating previews THEN the system SHALL show which fallback format each client will use
3. WHEN generating previews THEN the system SHALL create minimal visual previews as PNG files
4. WHEN previews are ready THEN the system SHALL include them in the downloadable ZIP package
5. WHEN displaying previews THEN the system SHALL indicate the estimated rendering quality for each client

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear error handling and warnings, so that I understand any limitations or issues with my logo file.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN file validation fails THEN the system SHALL display specific error messages explaining the issue
2. WHEN SVG complexity exceeds VML capabilities THEN the system SHALL warn about Outlook Desktop limitations
3. WHEN file size approaches limits THEN the system SHALL warn about potential email client issues
4. WHEN processing encounters errors THEN the system SHALL provide actionable suggestions for resolution
5. WHEN warnings are displayed THEN the system SHALL still allow the user to proceed with available fallbacks

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want a responsive web interface that works on desktop and mobile devices, so that I can use the tool from any device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the application on any device THEN the system SHALL display a responsive interface
2. WHEN using touch devices THEN the system SHALL support touch-based drag and drop functionality
3. WHEN viewing on mobile THEN the system SHALL maintain usability with appropriate touch targets
4. WHEN processing files on mobile THEN the system SHALL provide progress indicators for longer operations
5. WHEN downloading on mobile THEN the system SHALL handle ZIP file downloads appropriately for the device
