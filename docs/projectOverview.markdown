# Project Overview: LogoSync for Code with Kiro Hackathon

## Concept
LogoSync is a productivity tool for the "Code with Kiro" hackathon, designed to simplify embedding logos in emails across platforms like Gmail, Outlook, and Apple Mail. Users upload an image, SVG, or CSS logo, and LogoSync generates a single, optimized HTML code block with fallbacks (PNG, VML) and instructions, ensuring compatibility without hosting images.

## Hackathon Fit
- **Category**: Productivity & Workflow Tools
- **Goal**: Save developers time by automating cross-client email logo integration.
- **Kiro Integration**: Kiro assists in building the platform (e.g., generating UI components, backend logic for file processing, and workflow automation hooks). It does not generate the output code to ensure precise client-specific formatting.
- **Prizes Targeted**: Best Productivity & Workflow Tools ($5,000), Most Innovative Use of Kiro ($2,000).

## Features
- **Input**: Drag-and-drop upload for image (PNG/JPEG), SVG, or CSS logos.
- **Processing**: Validates and optimizes files (e.g., compress images, minify CSS), converts SVG to PNG/VML, embeds inline data URIs.
- **Output**: ZIP file with:
  - HTML snippet with layered fallbacks (SVG, PNG, VML).
  - Fallback PNG file.
  - Markdown instructions for email integration.
- **No Hosting**: All assets are inline or downloadable, ensuring scalability.

## Why It Matters
Email clients (Gmail, Outlook) have inconsistent rendering (no SVG in Gmail, limited CSS in Outlook). LogoSync provides a one-stop solution, reducing manual tweaks and testing. It’s practical for the hackathon’s 6-week timeline (ends August 25, 2025) and leverages Kiro for efficient development.

## Development Plan
- **Week 1-2**: Use Kiro to scaffold UI (React) and backend (Node.js, Sharp/SVGO for processing).
- **Week 3**: Implement deterministic templates for Gmail/Outlook/Apple Mail.
- **Week 4**: Test outputs (Litmus/Email on Acid) and refine instructions.
- **Week 5**: Finalize open-source repo (MIT license), record <3-min demo video showcasing Kiro’s role (e.g., “Kiro generated this SVG parser”).

## Deliverables
- Public GitHub repo with OSI-approved license.
- Demo video showing functionality and Kiro’s contributions.
- Write-up on Kiro usage (e.g., UI code gen, hook automation).
